# Boomer Rocket Team

The Boomer Rocket Team is a group of multidisciplinary engineering students at the University of Oklahoma dedicated to the design, construction, and launch of high powered rockets.

We are regularly training and individually certifying new members with the National Rocketry Association (aka Tripoli), as well as building upon our existing foundation of expertise and resources.  Our hands-on projects in rocketry help us gain valuable experience applying engineering theory to real world systems.  Most of all, they prepare our team for the national competitions we participate in each year.  We rely heavily on teamwork both in experimentation and in competition.
